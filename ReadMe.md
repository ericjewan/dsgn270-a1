# Assignment 1: **Website Review** of *craftbeermarket.ca*

### **Visual Hierarchy**

The Craft Beer Market website offers an inviting appearance, and eyes are immediately directed to the *make a reservation* button. The website is very easy to navigate, and having the navigation bar at the top makes it a breeze to find what you’re looking for. The colours used in this web page give off an exciting and youthful feeling, and with the use of the white text there are no issues of low contrast ratios. In the current times of Covid-19, the goal of the web page is to allow customers to make reservations online and also view the menu, to ensure all social distancing measures are being met and contact within the restaurant is reduced. 
> There is a good use of visual hierarchy on the home page with the saying,
>
>> ”We’re Back, Baby!”
>
> This uses size and scale very well, and viewers know the restaurant is open as soon as the web page loads. 

The layout has overall a very effective use of visual hierarchy. Important aspects of the website are bolded, and in a larger font size so that the consumer see’s what they want to see first. 

### **Mental Models and Usability**

Like mentioned earlier in my first impressions, this site is very user friendly and does not violate any conventions. The homepage makes use of scrolling to show other topics, which is a very easy and common tactic that all web users are familiar with. The menu page is definitely a highlight of this website, giving users the option to decide which menu they would like to view instead of forcing the user to scroll through several menus to find what they are looking for. Along with the app used to create a reservation, is it very simple to use and self explanatory. There really aren't any flaws when it comes to usability, the website is extremely user friendly. All text areas of the website are very easy to read, including the menu with a classic black on white design. While going through the health and safety page, I was quick to notice how easy the page is the scan due to the use of symbols to describe what each section is describing. It is quite impressive how well this website is designed from a user experience standpoint, all aspects are not new to the user and the consumer will not feel overwhelmed with information.

### **Mobile Responsiveness**

When accessing the site from the mobile device, users can quickly find everything they are looking for. The use of scrolling is once again apparent, and a nice hamburger menu in the top left is a great way for users to navigate around the site. On the homepage, if users don’t want to scroll there are arrows that will scroll down through the site onclick. From my personal experience in the restaurant, each table has a QR code that when scanned will bring you directly to the menu. This is a very easy and foolproof way to reduce contact, while giving the customer everything they would expect pre-covid. As far as the menu when viewed on desktop the page is unfortunately unresponsive, but when viewed on mobile it is very easy to zoom in to find what you’re looking for. The mobile version of this website is very impressive and user friendly.
